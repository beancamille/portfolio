# Camille Bean's Portfolio
A repository to host my portfolio of code and labwork.

The website at <https://beancamille.github.io/portfolio> uses some files from external developers. CSS styling of the page and side menu uses [ui.js](../blob/master/js/pure/ui.js) and [pure-min.css](https://unpkg.com/purecss@2.0.3/build/pure-min.css), as well as a modified version of the [side-menu stylesheet](https://github.com/pure-css/pure/blob/master/site/static/layouts/side-menu/styles.css) from the Pure CSS [library](https://purecss.io/). PDF embedding is done using [pdfobject.min.js](../blob/master/js/pdfobject.min.js) from [PDFObject](https://pdfobject.com/).
