                <p>
                    From June of 2018 until May of 2020, I carried out experimental research under the guidance of Professor Jennifer Hoffman at 
                    Harvard University. Dr. Hoffman’s work focuses on nanoscale electronic and magnetic properties of novel materials. In my time in 
                    the lab, I was with the team for one of Dr. Hoffman’s molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) experiments. In MBE, elements are sublimated in an 
                    ultra-high vacuum chamber so that they interact and coat the surface of a substrate tile that is inside the chamber, forming a thin film over the substrate. 
                    This method yields films as thin as a single molecular layer, and the cleanliness of the substrate is critical to the quality of the film. 
                    My main task in the Hoffman lab has been to improve substrate preparation and cleaning procedures to improve MBE film quality. I also wrote LabView code for the MBE
                    system. I automated parts of the MBE growth process, allowing for a simpler growth procedure with internal record-keeping. Since late 2018, 
                    I have been investigating the efficacy of cleaning the substrate surface with ozone shortly before loading into the MBE system. I prepared 
                    two talks on the subject for delivery at the 2019 and 2020 American Physical Society March Meeting conferences.

                    Below are the slides I prepared for the 2019 APS March Meeting. That year, I presented the results of my investigation into the efficacy 
                    of ozone cleaning of strontium titanate (STO). STO is commonly used as a substrate for MBE. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was 
                    used to measure cleanliness, providing a ratio of carbon content to strontium content for each sample, before and after ozone cleaning. 
                    Carbon content indicates how much organic matter remains on the surface, and unclean surfaces have significant organic matter. STO is only made 
                    of the elements strontium, oxygen, and titanium. The strontium content will be the same across samples, so it is used to normalize the carbon content. 
                    Therefore, the carbon to strontium ratio (C/Sr) accurately depicts the carbon content of a sample. At this point in the experiment, it seemed that ozone 
                    cleaning was an appropriate technique. However, the results showed that XPS destabilized the sample surface and affected carbon accumulation post-measurement, 
                    causing “after” C/Sr measurements to need re-evaluation.

                    Below are the slides I prepared for the 2020 APS March Meeting, which was sadly canceled due to COVID-19 concerns. Once again, I prepared a talk on the 
                    ozone cleaning of STO. The same C/Sr metric was used, but the procedure was altered so that samples would not need to be measured twice. This avoided surface 
                    destabilization by XPS. In the new procedure, ozone cleaning was not found to be effective. However, two pre-ozone preparation procedures were used. The pre-ozone 
                    procedure could use either HF or HCl for an acid-etching step, and the procedure using HF yielded samples with much lower C/Sr. These results indicate that 
                    altering the pre-ozone procedure could be a more effective method of achieving cleaner surfaces.

                <p>
                    This project was completed in 2019 during a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU), which is a summer research program supported by the National Science Foundation 
                    that allows undergraduate researchers to expand their research beyond their home institutions. This REU was done at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, under 
                    the mentorship of Professor Nadya Mason. Dr. Mason's work focuses on electron behavior in low-dimensional, correlated materials. My project in Dr. Mason’s lab was to influence 
                    the magnetic anisotropy (planar direction of magnetic orientation) of yttrium iron garnet (YIG). Being able to tune the anisotropy is important to applications in spintronics 
                    (electronics that exploit magnetic moment) and magnetism studies. Below is the paper that I wrote at the REU’s conclusion to document the project for UIUC and the NSF.
