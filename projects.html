                <p>
                    The final project for the course I took in Systems Development was to implement a software library 
                    for automatic differentiation, which is a derivation method distinct from both symbolic and numeric 
                    differentiation. I completed this project with three other students, and our library allows for both 
                    point evaluation and optimization for multivariable inputs. Our implementation and documentation can be 
                    found on <a href="https://github.com/ad-lib27/cs207-FinalProject" alt="SD Final Project GitHub">GitHub</a>. 
                    The library can also be downloaded from <a href="https://pypi.org/project/adlib27/" alt="SD Final Project PyPi">PyPI</a> 
                    using the command <code>pip install adlib27</code>.

                <p>
                    The final project for the course I took in Computational Science was to solve a data-intensive or compute-intensive problem, 
                    using the methods and infrastructure that had been covered in the course. I completed this project with three other 
                    students, and we chose to use big data methods to model the COVID-19 outbreak. We implemented graphical modeling using 
                    Spark-supported Graphframes with Pyspark, allowing us to simulate the spread of the disease over a social network of people. 
                    Our implementation and documentation can be found on  <a href="https://github.com/huilisabrina/covid-19-simul" alt="CS Final Project GitHub">GitHub</a>.
