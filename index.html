            <p>
                From June 2018 to May 2020, I carried out laboratory research as a part of my undergraduate 
                education. My research was concentrated in experimental condensed matter physics, which is a 
                field that focuses on the properties of matter as condensed materials (as opposed to individual particles).
                Most of the research that I completed was related to the fabrication and analysis of thin film materials. 
            </p>

            <h2 class="content-subhead">Computer Science Experience</h2>
            <p>
                In my undergraduate studies, I completed courses in systems development, computer hardware, and 
                computational science. All of my most significant coding projects were written as final projects for computer 
                science coursework, and I have primarily coded in Python.
